## Programming Assignment

### Equation of a Straight Line
This C++ program computes the equation of a straight line, given two user-input
points in the Cartesian plane. First, the program instructs the user to input
two points. Each point has a x and y-coordinate. Second the program computes
the equation of a straight line through the given points. Third, the program
displays the equation of the line:
  > y = m*x + b
  where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept

### Body Mass Index
This C++ program computes a person's body mass index (BMI). BMI is often used
to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is healthy,
overweight, or underweight for their height. A person's BMI is calculated using
the following formula:
  > BMI = weight * (703/(height)^2)
  where *weight* is measured in pounds and *height* is measured in inches

A BMI between 18.5 and 25 is considered healthy while a BMI less than 18.5 is
considered underweight and a BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight.

The C++ program does the following:
  1. Instructs the user to input their weight in pounds and height in inches
  2. Computes the user's BMI
  3. Determines if the user is healthy, underweight, or overweight based on the
  BMI
  4. Displays the user's BMI and health condition

### Letter or Digit
This C++ program determines if the input character is a uppercase or lowercase
letter or a digit. It assumes that each character is encoded using the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). For example, the letter 'A'
is stored as an integer value of 65.

The C++ program does the following:
  1. Instructs the user to input a character
  2. Determines if the input character is an uppercase or lowercase letter or a
  digit
  3. Display the classification

### Determining Location
This C++ program determines the location of an user-input point on a Cartesian
plane.

The C++ program does the following:
  1. Instructs the user to input the coordinates of a point
  2. Determines if the point is in one of four quadrants
  3. Determines if the point is at the origin
  4. Determines if the point is on the positive or negative x-axis
  5. Determines if the point is on the positive or negative y-axis
  6. Display the result
